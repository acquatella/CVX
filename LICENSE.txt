Thank you for using CVX! 

The files contained in this distribution are covered under one of two licenses, which
for the purpose of this discussion we will call the "CVX Standard" license and the "CVX
Professional" license. The "CVX Standard License" is effectively the GPLv2 license, as
published by the Free Software Foundation, but with a clarification or restriction that
ensures that modified versions of CVX do not connect to commercial, proprietary solvers.

The CVX Professional License
-----------------------------

Any files provided in Matlab p-code format are covered by the CVX Professional license.
These include, but are not limited to, the following files:
    mosek/cvx_solver_shim.p
    gurobi/cvx_solver_shim.p
    cvx_license.p
You may redistribute these files, but only in unmodified form. You may also distribute
a version of CVX with these files REMOVED. The resulting "CVX Standard" version of CVX 
will retain full functionality, with the exception of its ability to connect to non-free
commercial solvers. This modified distribution must adhere to the CVX Standard License, 
discussed below. You must include this entire file, INCLUDING the CVX Professional license
text, with your modified distribution.

The CVX Standard License
------------------------

Those files not specifically covered by the CVX Professional license are covered instead
by the CVX Standard license. Except for the restriction offered below, you are free to 
redistribute and/or modify the files covered under this license under the terms of the GNU
General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of 
the License ("GPLv2"), or (at your option) any later version. In particular, you must 
include the full content of this file, as well as the file GPL.txt, when redistributing 
this software.

Two of the key goals of our licensing approach are
	- to ensure the free availability of standard CVX functionality; and
	- to protect our opportunity to generate revenue by selling interfaces to commercial
      solvers to commercial customers.
With those goals in mind, the CVX Standard License forbids the distribution of modified
versions of CVX that connect to solvers that are not free for *all* users, both academic
and commercial. Some would interpret the GPLv2 in such a way that this injunction is
redundant; we offer it to ensure that this restriction is clear and explicit.

We encourage the work of others to modify CVX to work with other free solvers, and we
may be willing to collaborate with you on such an effort. Please contact info@cvxr.com
if you are interested. If you create such a modification, please consider submitting it
to CVX Research, Inc. for inclusion in the standard CVX distribution.

If you are a vendor or developer of a commercial solver, and would like to offer CVX as a
Matlab interface for that solver, please contact CVX Research, Inc. and info@cvxr.com. We 
welcome the opportunity to support a wider variety of commercial solvers with CVX, and are
willing to devote engineering resources to make those connections.

If you are a user of a commercial solver, and would like to see it supported by CVX,
please contact us at info@cvxr.com as well. We will certainly consider your request, and
if it proves technically feasible, we will reach out to the solver vendor to work on an
implementation.

A full copy of the GNU General Public License can be found in the file GPL.txt in the same
directory as this file. If you did not receive a copy of this file, please contact CVX 
Research, Inc. at info@cvxr.com.
